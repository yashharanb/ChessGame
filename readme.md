# Installing

First, clone this repository.

Then, run

### cd frontend
- run:

### `npm install`


Then 

### cd backend
- run:

### `npm install`

To start the server, use the command:

### `npm run dev`
this will sense any changes made to .js files and reload the server and client so that we do not have to manually do that.


After that point, you should be able to run everything.
